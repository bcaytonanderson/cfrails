As a real-time mentor for CareerFoundry, I help guide students
through online lessons teaching web development. The back end
portion of the course covers Ruby on Rails, and shows students
how to build their own projects using the framework.

This app is the result of me following along with the lessons,
and can be used as a reference for improving the current lessons
and for improving my own understanding of what each lesson
specifically entails.
